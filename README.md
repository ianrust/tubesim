TODOs

Make sidelines by either expanding Tube to have a special "1-sided" mode or it's own class
    they need to have way different indexing and have the ability for angles

Serial to browser w/ frequencies 

Get index -> spatial location working w/ a common definition with the Tube object since so much of that lives there. In the future this could be a config file?

try adding diffusers, ie cylinders w/ low alpha and blend turned on.
